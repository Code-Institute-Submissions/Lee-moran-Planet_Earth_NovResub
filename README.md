## WHY THIS
This has been an ongoing problem for the planet, and since the world has reopened from covid pandemic we have put aside the real issue on saving our planet. surely if we caused these disasters we can fix them. This is why we need everyone todo there part.

Scientists say eight years left to avoid worst effects.” : “IPCC climate report gives us 10 years to save the world.” 22-jan-2022

The massive melting of glaciers as a result of global heating has caused marked shifts in the Earth's axis of rotation since the 1990s,

Global sea level rise accelerated since 2013 to a new high in 2021, with continued ocean warming and ocean acidification.

I decided to build this project, because I personally believe this is our future, and I would like more people to be aware of this, get interested and try to understand it. For those who have the same interests as me, I hope this site can be a place to share and exchange information, knowledge and opinions about the planet and how we all can make a difference.

Consumers who come to the site are greated depending on there loged in status or not. Being a member of the site gives you more accessibility being able to write, like and comment on individual blogs.

I decided that any new post or comment added by the user needs approval, reasons being:

I have no one to moderate the post, that is the reason any posts coming from user needs to be approved by admin first, they will be left as a draft until admin approves.
To prevent spam, and/or post that is unrelated to Planet Earth 
To make sure the language is appropriate

## Fonts and Color scheme 
***Exo & Ubuntu*** are the primary fonts I wanted to use because there soft and complamentarty. Giving of a sense of peace. the stroke in these font work well together. 
- [Exo](https://fonts.google.com/?query=exo&preview.text=Planet%20Earth%20&preview.layout=row&preview.text_type=custom)
- [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?query=ub&preview.text=Planet%20Earth%20&preview.layout=row&preview.text_type=custom)

As a fall back I used ***Roboto and lato***  which is a front i used before and lato as well as the standard sans serif. Good idea to have a fall back so your content is viewable.

In terms of the color scheme I went with something slightly different. I used the planet as inspiration. I think these colors bring warmth and a real feel for the earth with the browns blues and greens. Using different variation of the colors.

## Testing 
[Jigsaw CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS code

CSS code passes the validator with no errors, however, there are some warnings, please see details in the screenshot. I looked into them, and don’t really know how to fix them at the moment, so I just left them there.

[Nu Html checker](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate HTML code

Only a few warnings such as white space.

## Installations
Below are the installations we need before writing any code

Install the server to use when deploy on Heroku
```bash
pip3 install django gunicorn
```

Supporting libraries:
``` bash
Postgresql and psycopg2
pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
```

Run Cloudinary
``` bash
pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
```

Create file list:
Create requirement.txt
``` bash
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

Create new django project:
```bash
django-admin startproject Filename:
```

Create blog app
```bash
python3 manage.py startapp blog
```

## Issues resolved
Your Blogs page has an edit and delete button. Delete btn wouldnt work due to its properties.
I had 2 properties instead of 3.. As Bootstrap5 requirers 3 properties.

# Deployment
This project was developed using a [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/ "Link to GitPod") workspace. The code was commited to [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Link to Git") and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/ "Link to GitHub") using the terminal.

## Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:
    - In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
    - In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL.
    - In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory. 
    - Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
    - Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
    - Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
    - Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py file also.
    - In settings.py add the following sections:
        - Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
        - STATICFILE_STORAGE
        - STATICFILES_DIRS
        - STATIC_ROOT
        - MEDIA_URL
        - DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
        - TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

4. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
    - Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
    - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
        - web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
    - Log in to Heroku using the terminal heroku login -i.
    - Then run the following command: **heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here** and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
    - After linking your app to your workspace, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command **git push heroku main** and your app will be deployed to Heroku.
