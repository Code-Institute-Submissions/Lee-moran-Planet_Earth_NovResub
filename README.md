## WHY THIS
This has been an ongoing problem for the planet, and since the world has reopened from covid pandemic we have put aside the real issue on saving our planet. surely if we caused these disasters we can fix them. This is why we need everyone todo there part.

Scientists say eight years left to avoid worst effects.” : “IPCC climate report gives us 10 years to save the world.” 22-jan-2022

The massive melting of glaciers as a result of global heating has caused marked shifts in the Earth's axis of rotation since the 1990s,

Global sea level rise accelerated since 2013 to a new high in 2021, with continued ocean warming and ocean acidification.

I decided to build this project, because I personally believe this is our future, and I would like more people to be aware of this, get interested and try to understand it. For those who have the same interests as me, I hope this site can be a place to share and exchange information, knowledge and opinions about the planet and how we all can make a difference.
